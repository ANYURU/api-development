# Django and Supabase
## Django custom authentication with supabase. 
In this project, I'll be connecting django with supabase and using supabase for authenticating my users. 


## Challenges. 
I had a challenge installing some psycopg2 using pip. I had to first install postgresql then reinstall psycopg2.
Used *postgresql_psycopg2* for the database engine
